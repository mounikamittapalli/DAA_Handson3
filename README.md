1.The outer loop runs n times
for each outer loop iteration, the inner loop runs n times.
Thus, the total number of iterations of the inner loop is n^2
t(n)=n^2 times
total operations: i=1∑n j=1∑n 1


2.please check code of [function.py](https://github.com/mounikamittapalli/DAA_Handson3/blob/268969d220afdcb5fd249724d8bc4be00dfb515c/function.py)

3.**big-o (upper bound)**: The function is upper bounded by 𝑂(𝑛^2)
                        o(n^2) meaning that the algorithm will never take more than quadratic time.
**big-omega (lower bound)**:since the runtime will always be proportional to n^2 or greater (even in the best case),
                        we have ω(𝑛^2)

**big-theta (tight bound):** big-theta represents the exact asymptotic behavior.since the polynomial fitting shows that the time complexity is dominated 
                         by n^2
                         we can say θ(𝑛^2)

4.please check code of  **Function2.py**(

4.please check code of **function3**
(https://github.com/mounikamittapalli/DAA_Handson3/blob/268969d220afdcb5fd249724d8bc4be00dfb515c/function3.py)

5.Since the number of operations remains n^2, the addition of y = i + j; will not affect the overall time complexity or the measured runtime in terms of big-O. The runtime may increase slightly because there is an additional operation inside the inner loop, but it will still follow the same quadratic growth pattern.

Answer: It will slightly increase the runtime, but it won't change the big-O complexity.

6.please check code of **merge_sort**
(https://github.com/mounikamittapalli/DAA_Handson3/blob/268969d220afdcb5fd249724d8bc4be00dfb515c/merge_sort.py)
