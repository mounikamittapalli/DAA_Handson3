1.The outer loop runs n times<br/>
for each outer loop iteration, the inner loop runs n times<br/>
Thus, the total number of iterations of the inner loop is n^2<br/>
T(n)=n^2 times<br/>
Total operations: i=1‚àën j=1‚àën 1


2.please check [function.py](https://github.com/mounikamittapalli/DAA_Handson3/blob/268969d220afdcb5fd249724d8bc4be00dfb515c/function.py)<br/>

3.**big-o (upper bound)**: The function is upper bounded by ùëÇ(ùëõ^2)<br/>
  *Tabspace* *Tabspace**Tabspace*o(n^2) meaning that the algorithm will never take more than quadratic time.<br/>
**big-omega (lower bound)**:since the runtime will always be proportional to n^2 or greater (even in the best case)<br/>
 *Tabspace* *Tabspace* *Tabspace*so time complexity is œâ(ùëõ^2)<br/>
**big-theta (tight bound):** big-theta represents the exact asymptotic behavior.since the polynomial fitting shows that the time complexity is dominated by n^2 <br/>
*Tabspace* *Tabspace* *Tabspace*so time complexity is  Œ∏(ùëõ^2)

5.Since the number of operations remains n^2, the addition of y = i + j<br/>
it will not affect the overall time complexity or the measured runtime in terms of big-O.<br/>
The runtime may increase slightly because there is an additional operation inside the inner loop,<br/>
but it will still follow the same quadratic growth pattern.<br/>
So,it will slightly increase the runtime, but it won't change the big-O complexity.
